00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
I thought my way out of that cave became Iron Man.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
I realized I loved you.

00:17.000 --> 00:27.000
I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
But world has changed.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
None of us can go back.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
All we can do is our best.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
And sometimes it's the best that we can do.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
It's the start over.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I saw all these people die.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
I keep telling everybody they should move on.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Some do.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
They man us.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Even if there's a small chance, we owe this.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
To everyone who's not in this room to try.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
We will.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Whatever it takes.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Whatever it takes.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Whatever it takes.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Whatever it takes.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
All we can do is we owe this.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
All we can do is we owe this.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I like this one.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I like this one.
